# STEGANOGRAPHY
This is a Steganography project developed in python 

## TECHNOLOGY USED
+ Programming Language: Python
+ Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Pillow (PIL)
+ Algorithm: Least Significant Bit (LSB) Steganography
+ Security Measures: AES Encryption for additional security layer
+ User Interface: Tkinter for GUI

## CONCLUSION
The project successfully hides encrypted data inside an image using LSB steganography. The original and modified images appear nearly identical to the human eye, making detection difficult. The hidden data can be extracted with the correct decryption key, ensuring security and confidentiality.
